# Basic-API-Practice
In  this code I have practiced API building
This project is basically based on the Model-Repository-Service-Controller design pattern
the model is used to write the data ligic for the code
the Repository is basically the database but as i have no databases connected therefore i have used the hashmap data structure as the DB
the service layer basically has the business logic
the controller basically interacts with the service layer and the service layer fetches data from the reppository and responds to the controller
